## What is Homigrad?

Homigrad is a gamemode that expands on an existing game mode called 'Homicide,' which is inspired by Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT) and Murder.\
It features a somewhat realistic health and movement system and offers several sub-modes, including Team Deathmatch (TDM), Deathmatch, and Hide and Seek.

## Installation

1. [Download the repository](https://github.com/JonnyBro/homigrad/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Subscribe to this collection: [\*click\*](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3393369855).
3. Extract the `homigrad-main` folder and place it in `your_gmod_install/garrysmod/addons` folder or server’s `addons` directory.
4. Move the `data` folder from `homigrad-main` to `your_gmod_install/garrysmod/`.
   - This folder contains points data that are used in some modes.
5. Ensure the gamemode is set to `Homigrad` (use `+gamemode homigrad` for servers).

A tickrate from **99** to **128** is recommended to improve controls when faking.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What language is your fork in?

My fork supports English, Russian, and Ukrainian languages!

### Can I use movement/weapons code from your fork in other gamemodes (Sandbox, TTT, etc)?

The movement system and weapons from Homigrad are not directly compatible with other gamemodes. However, if you're proficient, you might explore [Harrison’s movement-addon branch](https://github.com/harrisoniam/homigrad/tree/movement-addon).

### Can I customize your fork for my server?

You’re free to modify the files, adjust values, and tweak the code to suit your server’s needs. Just don't forget where you got this and leave a star :3

### Can I create my own gamemode using your fork?

Yes! Just like the original repo, this project is under the MIT License, so you’re welcome to use it as a base. Contributions are also encouraged — feel free to submit a pull request here or on [Harrison's repository](https://github.com/harrisoniam/homigrad).
