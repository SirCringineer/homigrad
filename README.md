## What is Homigrad?

Homigrad is a gamemode that expands on an existing game mode called 'Homicide,' which is inspired by Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT) and Murder.
It features a somewhat realistic health and movement system and offers several sub-modes, including Team Deathmatch (TDM), Deathmatch, and Hide and Seek.

## Installation

You are on your own for this one...

## TODO

- [ ] Learn Lua, so I can debug and fix shit
- [ ] Move Homigrad's commands to ULX. (ULX has been around for awhile, so I'll also stick with that)
- [ ] Find and fix existing bugs (there are many to address).


## Known Bugs

- [ ] Listed as `FIXME` and `NOTE` in comments.




## Frequently Asked Questions

### What language is your fork in?

My fork supports English, Russian, and Ukrainian languages!

Might be limited support for other languages from me, I'm a natively english only speaker. - Cring


### Can I use movement/weapons code from your fork in other gamemodes (Sandbox, TTT, etc)?

The movement system and weapons from Homigrad are not directly compatible with other gamemodes. However, if you're proficient, you might explore [Harrison’s movement-addon branch](https://github.com/harrisoniam/homigrad/tree/movement-addon).


### Can I customize your fork for my server?

You’re free to modify the files, adjust values, and tweak the code to suit your server’s needs. Just give credits where credit is due.


### Can I create my own gamemode using your fork?

Yes! Just like the original repo, this project is under the MIT License, so you’re welcome to use it as a base. Contributions are also encouraged — feel free to submit a pull request here or on [Harrison's repository](https://github.com/harrisoniam/homigrad).
